** Handling multiple monitor configuration
Use [[https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr][autorandr]] to handle multiple monitor configurations. The `default` config is set to aways go back to
laptop display only.

** Lock session
Use `xss-lock` and `i3lock`. `xss-lock` is started by awesome at startup. `i3lock` is called by either `xss-lock` or manually with a shortcut.
